<h1>What this is about!</h1>

This is an implementation of O(n2) Algorithm of Leader election in an Asyncronous ring topology of processors.<br> 
This program asks for the number of processors to be created and then creates a ring topology of those processors with id starting from 1 to number of processors.<br>
Then this algorithm runs the leader election algorithm<br>
