Prove the impossibility result for leader election for the anonymous ring.

The imposiibility result states that there is no anonymous leader election algorithm for ring systems :

The showed result applies for non-uniform algorithms and synchronous rings:
In synchronous systems, messages are delivered in rounds, after which a computation step is performed.
