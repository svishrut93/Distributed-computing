Implement the converge-cast algorithm as a recursion. [Input to the program is the root of the tree]
A tree is given in which each node has an integer (> 0 )value stored. Write a program so that 
1- The root has the max values from all the nodes.
2- The root has all the values of all the nodes concatenated 

The folder contains 3 java files. 
Node.java is the class for declaring object of type node. 
Every node has a data variable and references to the left and right of the node
-ïƒ Tree.java is the driver class for finding the maximum value in the tree where input to the program is root.(Question 1 
The tree constructed in the program has the following structure 
 
--> postorder.java is the driver program for question 2 . It outputs a list containing all the data inside every node of the tree, starting from root. 
The traversal technique followed for this is post-order traversal from the root of the tree. Both programs share the common Node.java class for constructing nodes inside the tree. 


To run the program : 
1.	Download Eclipse 
2.Import folder 
3.Run Tree.java: Question1 
4.Run postorder.java: Question 2
Feel free to contact me for any further clarifications on the code or how to run the Java program.
