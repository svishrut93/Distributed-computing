The Java program creates a DFS spanning tree based on the modified flooding algorithm .

1. Downlaod eclipse 
2. Import the folder called DCHW1VishrutSharma
3. This contains src folder inside contains 4 .java files
4. The folder contains a project and classpath file
5. Run the program from class Main.java: 


The init method inside Main.java creates the desired graph as specified by professor . 


Upon running Main.java:
-------------------------------------------------
1. The program will ask you to choose a root processor. 
Enter a value between 0 and 5 for the root processor. 
If a value that is not a processor in the graph is inputted, then the program gives an error message and exits. 

2. If a valid value is given as root, then the program runs and calculates the child and parent for every processor in the graph according to the modified flooding algorithm as discussed in class.  

3. The output is shown as the Parent identified for every processor inside the graph, after forming a spanning tree. 


4. Please see the output file containing the outputs generated by the program for different input value of root processor. 


Feel free to contact me for any further clarifications on the code or how to run the Java program.
